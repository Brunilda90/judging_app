##  Streamlit app for scoring competitions. 


Features

- Add judges and competitors

- Judges enter and update scores

- Scores auto-load when switching judges

- Leaderboard with totals & averages

To-DO List

- In the enter scores section for judges, list the competitors as buttons or some sort of clickable element
    - Clicking on the competitor should bring up the scoring page for that competitor

- Instead of entering a numeric score directly, add buttons 1-10 for each question
    - Calculate the average score and send that instead

- Admin should be able to create the question for Judges to fill out, full crud functionality for this as well.
    - Fully modular, as many questions as needed.

- Host the app


Thoughts

- Should I add weights for each question?
    - If so, How would I implement it?
